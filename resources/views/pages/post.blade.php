                            <p>This page is a collection of progressively more difficult exercises that are suitable for
                                people who just started learning. It will be extended as I come up with new exercises.
                                Except for the GUI questions, exercises are generally algorithmic and should be solvable
                                without learning any libraries. The difficulty of the exercises of course somewhat depends
                                on the programming language you use. The List exercises for example are more complicated in
                                languages like C that don’t have build-in support for lists.</p>

                            <p>Learning to program means learning how to solve problems using code. Conceptually it is not
                                very difficult to write a program that solves a problem that you can solve yourself. The
                                skill you need to acquire is thinking very precisely about how you solve the problem and
                                breaking it down into steps that are so simple that a computer can execute them. I encourage
                                you to first solve a few instances of a problem by hand and think about what you did to find
                                the solution. For example if the task is sorting lists, sort some short lists yourself.</p>
                            <p>A reasonable method would be to find the smallest element, write it down and cross it out of
                                the original list and repeat this process until you have sorted the whole list. Then you
                                have to teach the computer 1) how to find the smallest element, 2) how to write it down, 3)
                                how to cross it out, and wrap this in a loop. Then continue this task breakdown process
                                until you’re confident you know how to write the necessary program.</p>
                            <h3>Benefits Of ASync/Await In Programming</h3>
                            <p>To make good progress in your programming task, you need to test your work as early and as
                                thoroughly as possible. Everybody makes mistakes while programming and finding mistakes in
                                programs consumes a very large part of a programmer’s work-day. Finding a problem in a small
                                and easy piece of code is much simpler than trying to spot it in a large program. </p>
                            <p>This is why you should try to test each sub task you identified during your task-breakdown by
                                itself. Only after you’re confident that each part works as you expect you can attempt to
                                plug them together. Make sure you test the complete program as well, errors can creep in in
                                the way the different parts interact. You should try to automate your tests. The easier it
                                is to test your program, the freer you are in experimenting with changes.</p>
